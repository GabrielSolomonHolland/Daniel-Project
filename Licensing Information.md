All of this code is mine, any resemblance to others is unintentional or taken from stack overflow. I am using tkinter for my GUI and my understanding is that that is a open source license through Python, which means I don't need to obtain any other licenses to use it. If this is not the case please tell me and I will fix it. I really don't want to get sued and I am 99% sure I am doing things right
