# NDS-Reference-Values-DSH-GSH
Woodworking project for my brother Daniel

Goal of this project is to provide easy access to a series of tables regarding structural values of different species and grains of wood

For my brothers line of work he has a book of tables that he manually searches through to find values to calculate with.

This program should automatically scan through the tables and pull information at his request, reducing the busywork of reading pages of tables.

Ideally this project should expand to different types of steel at some point.
Ideally I will add a GUI and attach the code to an application, time estimation on that is unknown.

Explanation for lack of commits prior to this readme: I attempted to rename the repository to be something more self explanitory. Github then forgot my repository existed and I had to copy over all of the files. Essentially, I added 9 csv's of 9 species of woods to iterate through. I created a general selection method using input into the terminal which should be replaced with the addition of a GUI. The code is commented throughout and should be easy enough to read.
