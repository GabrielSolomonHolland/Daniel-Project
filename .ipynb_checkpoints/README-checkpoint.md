# NDS-Reference-Values-DSH-GSH
Woodworking project for my brother Daniel

Goal of this project is to provide easy access to a series of tables regarding structural values of different species and grains of wood

For my brothers line of work he has a book of tables that he manually searches through to find values to calculate with.

This program should automatically scan through the tables and pull information at his request, reducing the busywork of reading pages of tables.

Ideally this project should expand to different types of steel at some point.
Ideally I will add a GUI and attach the code to an application, time estimation on that is unknown.


# Plan update 8/11/2021:

* Make a GUI that takes the current code and create a functional window, potential convert to excecutable though that is a HUGE step a ways off

* Expand library to encompass all woods, steel

* Learn how to do calculations and perform them automatically

* Adapt presentation to give more detailed answers
