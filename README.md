# NDS-Reference-Values-DSH-GSH
Woodworking project for my brother Daniel

Goal of this project is to provide easy access to a series of tables regarding structural values of different species and grains of wood
For my brothers line of work he has a book of tables that he manually searches through to find values to calculate with.
This program should automatically scan through the tables and pull information at his request, reducing the busywork of reading pages of tables

Ideally this project should expand to different types of steel at some point.
